README.md content for your "printf" GitHub repository:

# Printf

This repository contains my implementation of the `printf` function in the C programming language. The `printf` function is a widely used function for formatted output in C. This implementation aims to provide similar functionality to the standard library `printf` function.

## Features

- Support for formatting specifiers such as `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%o`, `%f`, `%e`, `%E`, `%g`, `%G`, `%p`, `%n`, and `%%`.
- Basic flag modifiers such as `0`, `-`, `+`, ` `, and `#`.
- Field width and precision specification.
- Length modifiers for `h`, `hh`, `l`, `ll`.
- Variadic argument handling using the `<stdarg.h>` library.

## Usage

To use the `printf` function in your C programs, include the `printf.h` header file and compile the `printf.c` file along with your source code:

```c
#include "printf.h"

int main() {
    printf("Hello, %s! The answer is %d.\n", "world", 42);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile the program:

```bash
gcc main.c printf.c -o program
```

Run the program:

```bash
./program
```

## Documentation

For detailed information on supported format specifiers and usage examples, please refer to the `printf.h` header file and the provided documentation in the repository.
